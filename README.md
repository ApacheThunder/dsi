This is the *source* for DSi exploits/etc for DSiWare savedata. This repo is originally from 2011. These DSiWare exploits were already released in binary-only form(2011). The only exception is 4swordshax from 2011, which wasn't publicly available [until](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_dsiwarehax_installer) 2016 since it wasn't usable on DSi without(?) a nandmod(this is the only DSiWareHax that triggers in about 1-second after app boot before any gfx is displayed). There's currently no known way to successfully load the payload from 4swordshax, hence it will just display a red sub-screen on failure.

If you want a prebuilt binary for generictwlpayload(it can't be completely built from this repo), check the released exploit saveimages(for example [here](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_dsiwarehax_installer)).
